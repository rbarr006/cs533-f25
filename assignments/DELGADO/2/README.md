## Server Setup: Favorites & Cookies

This project demonstrates a basic Node.js server built with Express that features four custom routes. Each route serves simple HTML content and sets a unique, human-readable HTTP cookie. To run this server locally, you first need to install Node.js on your machine. Once Node is installed, use npm to pull in the necessary dependencies:

`npm install express cookie-parser`

## Starting the Server

Execute the main server file. In this project it'll be server.js `node server.js`. The server will run on localhost:4000. Navigate to the following four paths in your browser:

* For favorite show, use 	`/the_residence` 
* For favorite food, use `/lasagna`
* For favorite game, use `/osrs`
* For favorite animal, use `/creed`

## Demonstration

A screen recording was created to verify the project's functionality.
