are brewing between Israel and the Trump administration as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at his opposition to any Turkish security role in Gaza. Standing beside U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Jerusalem, Netanyahu’s pointed remark of “Want to guess what my opinion is?”, revealed deep Israeli mistrust toward Ankara. The two discussed Trump’s Gaza Peace Plan, which aims to disarm Hamas and establish an International Stabilisation Force. While Vance struck an optimistic tone, Netanyahu’s comments exposed widening cracks over who will control post-war Gaza.
